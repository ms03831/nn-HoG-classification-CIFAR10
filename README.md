# Classification of the CIFAR10 dataset:
We use the following algorithms to classify the CIFAR10 dataset.
###### - CNN
###### - Histrogram of Oriented Gradients (with SVM for classification)

## Assignment 1 for a Computer Vision course taken in Spring 2020:
### Objectives of the assignment:
-------
- To understand the usage of numpy for vectorized coding and perform preprocessing of data set
- To perform feature extraction and apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on extracted features
- To create dense and sparse neural network classifiers from scratch and apply on CIFAR-10 dataset
- To perform regularization to improve the trained networks
- To create neural network classifier using transfer learning (trained on ImageNet) and apply on CIFAR-10
dataset
- To perform hyperparameter tuning
